How do I run .sh file shell script in Linux?

`sudo bash dlunzipwp.sh`

Note:
(Spanish and Portuguese Portugal) - In the current version of WordPress 5.4.2, inside wp-config.php, different from some previous versions, the default values such as ('pon aqu√≠ tu phraseandom'), no is in current language, but in English. Therefore, when downloading a previous version, which has the sentence in Spanish, the script will not carry out the necessary configuration changes. Because I'm relying on the latest version.
